# Brand

The brand container allows you to render different types of brand variations using the logo image queried from assets.

Currently only, this container allows for one variation to render but will be updated to include more variety.

## Roadmap

- Variations prop to render different brand variations:
  - "name" - renders brand name without logo.
  - "logo" - renders brand logo without name.
  - "short" - render brand name using acronym
  - "unlinked" - render without link wrapper
