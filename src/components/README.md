# Components

Components are broken up into modules. As the library evolves, so will the organization of these files. For now, keeping them in a single directory makes the most sense. For now, the order in which the components are exported matters because of style inheritance.

## MDX

- Use this module for all MDX related components.

## UI Components

- These are core UI components meant to be reusable and can be used to create other custom components.
- Can use TailwindCSS and/or scoped CSS modules.
