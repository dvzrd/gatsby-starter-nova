# Icon Component

Use `Icon` to render different icons by using the `name` prop.

Defaults to an icon pattern which can be styled in whatever way you want using the pattern component api.

## Resources

Icons are just svg files, if you need an icon, just add it to the component's render method. Here are some resources for free icons:

- [Hero Icons](https://heroicons.com/)
- [Free Flat Icons](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/)

## Roadmap

- define `IconColor` types using a global color type.
- define more `IconName` types.
