# Element Component

Use this primitive component as an HTML element to create other components.

## Resources

- [Tailwind React Primitives by emortlock](https://github.com/emortlock/tailwind-react-primitives) - The element component and the choice to use primitive as a namespace was inspired by this library. May consider using this as a base after version 1 is released.
