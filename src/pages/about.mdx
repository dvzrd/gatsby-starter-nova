<Pattern as="h2" utils="py-8 md:py-10 xl:py-12">
  This page is built with MDX
  <Pattern as="hr" is="divider" className="mb-4" />
  <Text pattern="meta" className="block">
    Dated 10/04/2020
  </Text>
</Pattern>

### This is an h3 in markdown syntax

<Pattern as="hr" is="divider" utils="mb-6" />

**This is bold markdown:**

<Pattern utils="py-1" />

You can still write your pages in plain markdown, mixed in with regular HTML with Taiwind CSS or custom CSS classes. It's up to you what you want to do. You can also imort other components at the top of the file if for some reason you don't want to add it to the components shortcode config insde the `MDX` component.

```
import { SketchPicker } from "react-color"

# Hello, world!

Here's a color picker!

<SketchPicker />
```

Check out [`gatsby-plugin-mdx`](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-mdx/) for more details.

<Pattern utils="py-6 md:py-8 xl:py-10" />

<Text as="h5" pattern="title" utils="mb-6">
  This is an h5 title text pattern with a bottom margin
</Text>

You can also write your own code in markdown, although that's not recommended you can technically do it. Go search for that though, I remember seeing an example a while back but I can't find it right now.

<Section is="content" isContained utils="py-8 md:py-10 xl:py-12">

#### This is a contained content section component with vertical padding

<Box className="gap-4 grid md:grid-cols-3 my-6">
  <Text as="p" className="md:mb-6">
    You can use component shortcodes
  </Text>
  <p className="md:mb-6">You can write regular HTML content.</p>
  <Element as="p" className="md:mb-6">
    Whatever components you pass to or define in MDX will be available as
    shortcodes.
  </Element>
</Box>

You can use regular markdown syntax, but not in a grid - have to wrap that in a div or something man. I mean give me something to work with here dude.

</Section>

###### This is an h6

This is just a regular markdown paragraph.

<Hero
  as="section"
  of="fluid"
  bgColor="primary"
  color="primary"
  utils="mt-20"
  caption={{
    context: (
      <Text as="h4" pattern="body">
        This is why this component is here, to save you from the pain of not
        having a hero when you need one.
      </Text>
    ),
    heading: "Sometimes you need a hero",
  }}
/>
