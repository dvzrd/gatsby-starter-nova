# Layouts

Layouts are used to structure different types of pages.

## Roadmap

- `LayoutDashboard` for creating dashboard style pages.
- Use theme to set different image meta (light and dark).
- Refactor the layouts module into a gatsby theme / plugin.
- `LayoutLanding` for creating landing pages, single pages, marketing pages, and more.
